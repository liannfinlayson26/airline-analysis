###Airline Analysis on Python

Using libraries such as Pandas, NumPy and Seaborn we created a stunning set of visual graphs to represent the analysis

I explored the ins and outs of airline prices. I wanted to find the best deals and understand how airline prices change based on different factors.

The data include:
- `miles`: miles traveled through the flight
- `passengers`: number of passengers on the flight
- `delay`: take-off delay in minutes
- `inflight_meal`: is there a meal included in the flight?
- `inflight_entertainment`: are there free entertainment systems for each seat?
- `inflight_wifi`: is there complimentary wifi on the flight?
- `day_of_week`: day of the week of the flight
- `weekend`: did this flight take place on a weekend?
- `coach_price`: the average price paid for a coach ticket
- `firstclass_price`: the average price paid for first-class seats
- `hours`: how many hours the flight took
- `redeye`: was this flight a redeye (overnight)

How can we improve the arline?
